if - exp / single stm / multi stm ?
unreachable code remark
more basic int operators * \ %
label - first class ?
goto
coverage analysis (execution count of exp)
ref
comparison operators > < >= <= == !=
logical operators not and or
bitwise operators << >> & | ~ ^

unittests: parser, unknown operators, validator
fix: underflow in lax mode
better error messages: var, texts in general, include subject of error, suggest similar variables, start-end line and column
review all trusted, cast, assert and catch (std and err printers are nothrow, should they throw?)
